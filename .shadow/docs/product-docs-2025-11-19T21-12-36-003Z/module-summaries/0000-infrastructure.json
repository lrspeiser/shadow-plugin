  "summary": "The Infrastructure module provides a centralized progress notification service that enhances user experience during long-running operations. It enables the application to display consistent, informative progress indicators that keep users informed about ongoing tasks.\n\nUsers benefit from clear visual feedback when operations take time to complete, with the ability to cancel tasks if needed. Progress notifications can include both titles and dynamically updated messages, providing context about what's happening at each stage. The service supports multiple display locations, allowing progress information to appear in the most appropriate part of the interface—whether as a prominent notification or a subtle status bar indicator.\n\nThis module standardizes how progress is communicated throughout the application, ensuring users always have visibility into system activity and control over cancellable operations. It abstracts the complexity of progress management, providing a uniform interface for displaying task status regardless of the underlying operation type.",
