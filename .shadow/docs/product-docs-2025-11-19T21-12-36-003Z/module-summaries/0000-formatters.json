  "summary": "The formatters module provides documentation generation and formatting capabilities that convert raw product analysis and code insights into polished, user-ready Markdown documents. It serves as the presentation layer for all documentation output, ensuring consistent formatting and organization across different documentation types.\n\nUsers can generate comprehensive product documentation that includes feature overviews, behavioral summaries, and usage examples from multiple perspectives (GUI, CLI, and API). The module automatically organizes file analysis results into logical categories, making it easy to understand codebase structure and component purposes. All generated documentation includes timestamps and proper sectioning, with clear warnings when information is missing or incomplete.\n\nThe primary workflow involves taking structured data from code analysis and LLM insights, then transforming it into readable, exportable Markdown documents. This enables users to view, share, and export documentation that accurately represents their product's capabilities, architecture, and usage patterns in a standardized format suitable for both human consumption and further processing.",
