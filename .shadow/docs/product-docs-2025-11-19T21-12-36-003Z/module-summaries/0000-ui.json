  "summary": "The UI module provides a unified Reports Viewer interface that serves as a central hub for accessing all documentation and analysis reports generated by the extension. Users can view a webview panel displaying organized cards for each report type, including workspace summaries, product documentation, architecture diagrams, refactoring guides, and unit test documentation.\n\nThe Reports Viewer displays the current status of each report, showing whether it has been generated and when it was last updated. Each report card includes a descriptive label, brief description, and visual indicators for availability. Users can click on any available report card to open the corresponding HTML report in their default web browser, streamlining the workflow for reviewing generated documentation.\n\nThis centralized interface eliminates the need to navigate through the file system to find generated reports, providing a convenient dashboard that shows at a glance which reports are available and allows immediate access to them. The panel can be refreshed to reflect newly generated reports and closed when no longer needed.",
