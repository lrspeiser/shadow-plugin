  "summary": "The context module serves as a bridge between code analysis tools and AI-powered features by transforming raw analysis results into LLM-friendly formats. It automatically captures insights about code structure, dependencies, and relationships, then persists this information for future use.\n\nWhen code is analyzed, this module saves the results to a dedicated .shadow/docs directory within your project workspace. This creates a persistent cache of code intelligence that can be leveraged across multiple AI interactions without re-analyzing the same code. The module handles the conversion of technical analysis data into structured contexts that language models can effectively interpret and use for tasks like code generation, refactoring suggestions, and documentation.\n\nThe workflow is transparent to users: as you work with AI features that analyze your code, the context module automatically manages the storage and formatting of analysis results in the background. This cached analysis improves performance and consistency across AI-powered development workflows.",
