  "summary": "The handlers module provides comprehensive code navigation capabilities that enable users to explore their workspace through interactive navigation flows. Users can click on items in the product navigator or analysis viewer to instantly jump to the corresponding source code, whether it's a file, function, API endpoint, or reference location.\n\nWhen navigating to functions, the module automatically opens the file, positions the cursor at the function definition, and highlights the relevant code section. Users can view detailed function information in a quick pick menu that displays signatures, descriptions, and metadata before navigating. For API endpoints, the module intelligently locates and opens the handler implementation. The module also supports navigating from analysis results, displaying code context with proper syntax highlighting.\n\nThroughout all navigation workflows, the module provides helpful feedback through error messages when files cannot be opened and warnings when navigation targets are not found, ensuring users always understand the outcome of their navigation attempts.",
