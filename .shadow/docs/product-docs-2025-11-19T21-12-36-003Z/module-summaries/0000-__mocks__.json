  "capabilities": [
    "Enables isolated unit testing of VS Code extension code without requiring the actual VS Code extension host environment",
    "Provides mock implementations of core VS Code API objects including workspace, window, languages, and commands",

    "Allows developers to verify extension behavior through automated Jest tests in a CI/CD pipeline"

  "summary": "This testing infrastructure module provides mock implementations of the VS Code Extension API specifically designed for Jest unit tests. It enables developers to test extension functionality in isolation without launching the full VS Code environment, significantly speeding up test execution and enabling automated testing in continuous integration pipelines.\n\nThe module mocks essential VS Code API surfaces including workspace configuration, window UI elements, language features, and command registration. This allows extension developers to write comprehensive unit tests that verify their extension's logic, error handling, and integration with VS Code APIs while maintaining fast test execution times and deterministic test behavior.\n\nWhile this module has no direct user-facing features in the production extension, it provides critical testing infrastructure that ensures extension quality and reliability. Developers can run tests locally during development and in automated CI/CD pipelines to catch regressions and verify correctness before shipping updates to end users.",
