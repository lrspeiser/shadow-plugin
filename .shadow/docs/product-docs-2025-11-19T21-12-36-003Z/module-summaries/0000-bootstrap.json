  "summary": "The bootstrap module serves as the initialization and configuration layer for the VS Code extension, responsible for setting up all components when the extension activates. It orchestrates the registration of commands, initialization of UI elements (status bar, tree views, diagnostics), and configuration of services that power the extension's code analysis and insight generation capabilities.\n\nThis module enables users to interact with the extension through registered commands for analyzing code, navigating product structures, viewing insights, and managing extension data. It establishes the connection between user actions (like clicking buttons or triggering commands) and the underlying services that perform analysis, generate insights, and display results.\n\nThe bootstrap process creates a complete workflow infrastructure: users can analyze their workspace or individual files, view results in dedicated tree views, navigate through product features and test structures, copy insights to clipboard, and monitor extension status through the status bar. The module also sets up automatic re-analysis triggers when files change, ensuring insights stay current as code evolves.",
