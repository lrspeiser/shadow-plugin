  "summary": "The webview module provides the foundation for displaying custom web-based user interfaces within VSCode. It enables the application to show rich, interactive panels that can present information, forms, and visual content using HTML rendering. Users interact with these webview panels as they appear in the editor, with the module handling all the complexity of panel lifecycle management.\n\nWhen users trigger actions that require custom visualizations or interfaces, this module ensures webview panels are created, displayed, and managed consistently. The module handles bringing existing panels to the front when reactivated, cleaning up resources when panels are closed, and rendering content through a structured template system that ensures proper styling and functionality.\n\nThis infrastructure supports various types of webview-based features throughout the application, providing a reusable foundation that reduces code duplication and ensures consistent behavior. Users experience smooth transitions as panels open, update, and close, with the module handling all technical aspects of webview integration with the VSCode environment.",
