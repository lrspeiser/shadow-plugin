  "summary": "The persistence module provides the storage layer for all code analysis outputs, managing how documentation and insights are saved to the .shadow directory. It ensures that each analysis run is preserved with a unique identifier and timestamp, creating an organized historical record of all documentation generation activities.\n\nUsers benefit from automatic organization of their analysis results, with product documentation saved to .shadow/docs and architecture insights to .shadow/architecture. Each analysis session creates a complete snapshot including individual file documentation, summary overviews, and metadata, making it easy to track changes over time and reference previous analysis runs. The module handles all file system operations transparently, allowing users to focus on analyzing their code while documentation is reliably stored in a well-structured format.",
