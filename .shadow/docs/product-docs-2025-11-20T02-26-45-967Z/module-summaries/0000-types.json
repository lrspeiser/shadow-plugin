  "summary": "This module provides the type definitions that enable comprehensive test generation and execution tracking across an entire codebase. Users can monitor the complete testing lifecycle from initial setup through test generation, validation, and execution, with detailed visibility into which functions are testable, which have been tested, and which encountered issues. The types support organizing tests by function groups with priorities, tracking complexity and dependencies, and viewing granular results.\n\nThe module structures three main workflow areas: test planning (tracking progress and function analysis), test results (generation, validation, and execution outcomes), and test setup (environment configuration and initialization). Users receive clear feedback at each stage, including phase indicators, success/failure metrics, pass rates, execution durations, and actionable recommendations. Error details include test names, messages, and stack traces to facilitate debugging.\n\nThrough these type definitions, users can configure testing frameworks, establish test directories, install dependencies, generate test files with appropriate imports and mocks, validate test correctness, execute tests, and review comprehensive reports. The system provides both high-level summaries (total functions analyzed, overall pass rates) and detailed function-level information (complexity scores, dependencies, individual test results) to support effective test management and quality assurance workflows.",
