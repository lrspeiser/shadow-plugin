  "summary": "This infrastructure module provides a centralized progress notification system that keeps users informed during long-running operations throughout the application. It standardizes how progress is displayed, ensuring a consistent experience whether users are processing files, running analyses, or executing other time-intensive tasks.\n\nUsers see progress notifications that include descriptive titles and messages explaining what's happening. As operations proceed, the progress indicator updates incrementally to show completion status. For operations that support cancellation, users can click a cancel button to stop the process early. The service flexibly displays progress in different UI locations depending on the context, such as the notification area for background tasks or the window status bar for focused operations.\n\nThis module serves as the foundation for all progress reporting in the application, ensuring that users always have visibility into what the application is doing and how long operations might take. It eliminates uncertainty during long tasks and gives users control over cancellable operations.",
