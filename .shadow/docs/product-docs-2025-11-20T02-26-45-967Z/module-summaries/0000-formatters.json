  "summary": "The formatters module provides documentation generation capabilities that transform raw product data and AI insights into polished, human-readable Markdown documents. Users can generate comprehensive documentation that includes product overviews, feature descriptions, technical architecture details, and quality assessments, all formatted with consistent structure and clear sections.\n\nThis module enables users to create professional documentation that organizes information by interface type (GUI, CLI, API), presenting key features, main capabilities, and technical implementation details in an accessible format. The generated documents include timestamps, structured headings, and bullet-pointed lists that make it easy for developers and stakeholders to understand product capabilities and architecture.\n\nThe module also formats AI-generated insights, incorporating architectural pattern analysis, dependency assessments, and quality metrics into the documentation. Users can view improvement suggestions, technical recommendations, and action items in a clear, organized manner that facilitates decision-making and development planning. All documentation is formatted with proper Markdown syntax for seamless integration into documentation systems, wikis, or version control repositories.",
