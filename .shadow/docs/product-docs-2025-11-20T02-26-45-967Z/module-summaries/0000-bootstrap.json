  "summary": "This bootstrap module serves as the initialization layer for the VS Code extension, responsible for setting up all user-facing features and workflows when the extension activates. It coordinates the registration of commands, configuration of UI components, and establishment of automatic analysis triggers that enable users to interact with the extension's code intelligence capabilities.\n\nThe module handles two primary responsibilities: command registration and extension bootstrapping. Command registration maps user actions (such as analyzing files, copying insights, switching LLM providers, and navigating code) to their execution handlers, making these features accessible through the VS Code command palette, context menus, and keyboard shortcuts. Extension bootstrapping initializes all supporting infrastructure including tree view providers for insights and analysis results, file system watchers for automatic re-analysis, diagnostics providers for displaying warnings and errors, status bar indicators, and custom webview renderers for reports.\n\nUsers interact with this module indirectly through the features it enables. Upon activation, the extension becomes fully functional with visible UI elements (status bar, tree views in the sidebar), active command mappings (accessible via command palette), and automatic workflows (file change detection triggering re-analysis). This module ensures that all components work together cohesively, providing a seamless experience for code analysis, insight generation, unit test reporting, and navigation throughout the codebase.",
