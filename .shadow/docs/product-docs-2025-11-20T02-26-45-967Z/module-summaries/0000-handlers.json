  "summary": "The navigation handler module enables seamless code navigation within VS Code by managing all editor interactions triggered by user selections. When users interact with code analysis results, this module handles the heavy lifting of opening files, positioning the cursor, and displaying the relevant code context.\n\nUsers can click on any code item from analysis views—whether it's a file reference, function definition, API endpoint, or other code element—and the handler will automatically open the correct file in the editor and position the cursor at the exact location. This creates a smooth workflow where users can explore code relationships, trace dependencies, and investigate analysis findings without manually searching for files or locations.\n\nThe module provides robust error handling, displaying clear messages when files cannot be found or locations are invalid. This ensures users always receive feedback about navigation actions, whether successful or unsuccessful, maintaining a reliable and predictable editing experience.",
