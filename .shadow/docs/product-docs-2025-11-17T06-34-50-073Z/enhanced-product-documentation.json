  "overview": "Shadow Watch is a Visual Studio Code extension that continuously monitors and analyzes your codebase to identify architectural issues, code quality problems, and design patterns. It runs automatically in the background, analyzing your code whenever you save files, and presents findings through an intuitive sidebar interface. The extension specializes in preparing architecture insights in formats optimized for AI assistants like Cursor, ChatGPT, and other Large Language Models, enabling developers to quickly get AI-powered recommendations for fixing architectural problems. Shadow Watch detects common issues like god objects, circular dependencies, dead code, overly complex functions, and large files, categorizing them by severity (Error, Warning, Info) and providing actionable recommendations. The extension supports multiple programming languages including Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Go, Rust, C/C++, Ruby, and PHP.\n\nShadow Watch goes beyond basic code analysis by leveraging AI to generate comprehensive documentation. It can automatically create product documentation that describes what your application does from a user perspective, generate detailed architecture insights explaining design patterns and system organization, and even produce file-level documentation explaining the purpose of individual code files. The extension integrates with multiple LLM providers (Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama) to power these AI features. All analysis results are cached intelligently to ensure fast performance, with incremental updates that analyze only changed files rather than the entire codebase. Developers can copy insights with a single click in formats optimized for their preferred AI assistant, streamlining the workflow of identifying issues, getting AI recommendations, and implementing fixes.",

  "architecture": "Shadow Watch is built as a VSCode extension with a monitoring-and-analysis architecture. The core CodeAnalyzer component performs static analysis by parsing source code files to identify modules, entry points, dependencies, and code structure without executing the code. It uses Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parsing for deep function-level analysis and dependency graphing to track import relationships. The InsightGenerator processes raw analysis data to detect architectural anti-patterns like god objects, circular dependencies, dead code, and complexity issues, categorizing findings by severity and providing actionable recommendations. An intelligent AnalysisCache stores results with time-based expiration, enabling incremental updates that analyze only changed files rather than the entire workspace, achieving sub-second update times for single file modifications.\n\nThe FileWatcher monitors the workspace file system and triggers incremental analysis whenever files are saved or modified. Multiple tree view providers present different perspectives on the analysis: the InsightsTreeView shows categorized issues with severity indicators, the AnalysisViewerProvider displays workspace statistics and structure, the ProductNavigatorProvider shows AI-generated product documentation, the InsightsViewerProvider presents architecture insights, and the UnitTestsNavigatorProvider links source files to their tests. The LLMFormatter transforms insights into formats optimized for different AI assistants (Cursor, ChatGPT, generic markdown). The LLM Integration layer orchestrates interactions with multiple AI providers (Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama) using a unified service interface, managing prompt construction, API calls, and response parsing. A DiagnosticsProvider publishes detected issues to VSCode's standard Problems panel. Status indicators and commands provide user interaction points, with automatic activation when VSCode starts and continuous background processing that never blocks editing.",

  "rawContent": "{\"overview\":\"Shadow Watch is a Visual Studio Code extension that continuously monitors and analyzes your codebase to identify architectural issues, code quality problems, and design patterns. It runs automatically in the background, analyzing your code whenever you save files, and presents findings through an intuitive sidebar interface. The extension specializes in preparing architecture insights in formats optimized for AI assistants like Cursor, ChatGPT, and other Large Language Models, enabling developers to quickly get AI-powered recommendations for fixing architectural problems. Shadow Watch detects common issues like god objects, circular dependencies, dead code, overly complex functions, and large files, categorizing them by severity (Error, Warning, Info) and providing actionable recommendations. The extension supports multiple programming languages including Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Go, Rust, C/C++, Ruby, and PHP.\\n\\nShadow Watch goes beyond basic code analysis by leveraging AI to generate comprehensive documentation. It can automatically create product documentation that describes what your application does from a user perspective, generate detailed architecture insights explaining design patterns and system organization, and even produce file-level documentation explaining the purpose of individual code files. The extension integrates with multiple LLM providers (Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama) to power these AI features. All analysis results are cached intelligently to ensure fast performance, with incremental updates that analyze only changed files rather than the entire codebase. Developers can copy insights with a single click in formats optimized for their preferred AI assistant, streamlining the workflow of identifying issues, getting AI recommendations, and implementing

VSCode extension with a monitoring-and-analysis architecture. The core CodeAnalyzer component performs static analysis by parsing source code files to identify modules, entry points, dependencies, and code structure without executing the code. It uses Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parsing for deep function-level analysis and dependency graphing to track import relationships. The InsightGenerator processes raw analysis data to detect architectural anti-patterns like god objects, circular dependencies, dead code, and complexity issues, categorizing findings by severity and providing actionable recommendations. An intelligent AnalysisCache stores results with time-based expiration, enabling incremental updates that analyze only changed files rather than the entire workspace, achieving sub-second update times for single file modifications.\\n\\nThe FileWatcher monitors the workspace file system and triggers incremental analysis whenever files are saved or modified. Multiple tree view providers present different perspectives on the analysis: the InsightsTreeView shows categorized issues with severity indicators, the AnalysisViewerProvider displays workspace statistics and structure, the ProductNavigatorProvider shows AI-generated product documentation, the InsightsViewerProvider presents architecture insights, and the UnitTestsNavigatorProvider links source files to their tests. The LLMFormatter transforms insights into formats optimized for different AI assistants (Cursor, ChatGPT, generic markdown). The LLM Integration layer orchestrates interactions with multiple AI providers (Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama) using a unified service interface, managing prompt construction, API calls, and response parsing. A DiagnosticsProvider publishes detected issues to VSCode's standard Problems panel. Status indicators and commands provide user interaction points, with automatic activation when VSCode starts and continuous background processing that never blocks editing.\",\"titles\":[\"Continuous Architecture Monitoring\",\"LLM-Ready Insights\",\"God Object Detection\",\"Circular Dependency Detection\",\"Dead Code Identification\",\"Complex Function Analysis\",\"Large File Warnings\",\"Health Score Calculation\",\"One-Click LLM Export\",\"Cursor AI Integration\",\"ChatGPT Integration\",\"Product Documentation Generator\",\"AI Architecture Insights\",\"File Documentation Generator\",\"Unit Test Navigator\",\"Smart Caching System\",\"Incremental Analysis\",\"Real-Time File Watching\",\"Severity Classification\",\"Multi-Language Support\",\"Static Analysis Engine\",\"Dependency Graphing\",\"AST Parsing\",\"Issue Navigation\",\"Problems Panel Integration\"],\"descriptions\":[{\"title\":\"Continuous Architecture Monitoring\",\"description\":\"Automatically analyzes your codebase on every file save, detecting architecture issues and code quality problems in real-time without requiring manual triggers.
