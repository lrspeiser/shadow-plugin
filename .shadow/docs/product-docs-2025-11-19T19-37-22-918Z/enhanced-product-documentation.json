  "overview": "Shadow Watch is a Visual Studio Code extension that provides intelligent code analysis and documentation generation powered by AI language models. Users can analyze their codebase to automatically generate comprehensive documentation, architectural insights, and code quality assessments without manually writing documentation. The extension integrates directly into the VS Code interface, allowing developers to trigger analysis with simple commands and view results in dedicated panels within their editor. Shadow Watch supports multiple AI providers including OpenAI and Anthropic, enabling users to choose their preferred language model for analysis. The tool is designed to help development teams maintain up-to-date documentation, understand complex codebases, and identify areas for improvement through automated analysis that would otherwise require significant manual effort.",

  "architecture": "Shadow Watch is built as a VS Code extension with a modular architecture centered around AI-powered analysis. The core system consists of several key layers: an extension activation layer that bootstraps commands and UI components, an analysis engine that processes code files and generates structured data, an AI integration layer that communicates with language model providers, and a presentation layer that renders results in VS Code webviews. The extension uses a state management system to track analysis progress and cache results, ensuring efficient operation even with large codebases. File watching capabilities enable incremental analysis, detecting changes and updating only affected portions of the documentation. The architecture supports pluggable AI providers through a factory pattern, allowing seamless switching between OpenAI and Anthropic models. Results are persisted using a repository pattern that stores analysis data for quick retrieval and comparison. The system uses JSON schemas to define expected AI response formats, ensuring consistent and parseable output from language models. Rate limiting and retry mechanisms protect against API failures and usage limits. The UI layer consists of multiple specialized viewers (analysis viewer, insights viewer, reports viewer) that present different aspects of the analysis in user-friendly formats. Navigation handlers coordinate between these views and enable jumping to specific code locations from analysis results.",

  "rawContent": "{\"overview\":\"Shadow Watch is a Visual Studio Code extension that provides intelligent code analysis and documentation generation powered by AI language models. Users can analyze their codebase to automatically generate comprehensive documentation, architectural insights, and code quality assessments without manually writing documentation. The extension integrates directly into the VS Code interface, allowing developers to trigger analysis with simple commands and view results in dedicated panels within their editor. Shadow Watch supports multiple AI providers including OpenAI and Anthropic, enabling users to choose their preferred language model for analysis. The tool is designed to help development teams maintain up-to-date documentation, understand complex codebases, and identify areas for improvement through automated analysis that would otherwise require significant manual effort.\",\"whatItDoes\":[\"Analyzes codebases to automatically generate product documentation describing what applications do from a user perspective\",\"Provides architectural insights showing how code components relate and interact with each other\",\"Generates code quality assessments identifying potential issues, technical debt, and improvement

organization\",\"Offers refactoring suggestions with AI-generated recommendations for code improvements\",\"Enables incremental analysis that only processes changed files rather than re-analyzing

Code extension with a modular architecture centered around AI-powered analysis. The core system consists of several key layers: an extension activation layer that bootstraps commands and UI components, an analysis engine that processes code files and generates structured data, an AI integration layer that communicates with language model providers, and a presentation layer that renders results in VS Code webviews. The extension uses a state management system to track analysis progress and cache results, ensuring efficient operation even with large codebases. File watching capabilities enable incremental analysis, detecting changes and updating only affected portions of the documentation. The architecture supports pluggable AI providers through a factory pattern, allowing seamless switching between OpenAI and Anthropic models. Results are persisted using a repository pattern that stores analysis data for quick retrieval and comparison. The system uses JSON schemas to define expected AI response formats, ensuring consistent and parseable output from language models. Rate limiting and retry mechanisms protect against API failures and usage limits. The UI layer consists of multiple specialized viewers (analysis viewer, insights viewer, reports viewer) that present different aspects of the analysis in user-friendly formats. Navigation handlers coordinate between these views and enable jumping to specific code locations from analysis results.\",\"titles\":[\"AI-Powered Code Analysis\",\"Product Documentation
