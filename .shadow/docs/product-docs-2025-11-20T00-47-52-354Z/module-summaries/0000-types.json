  "summary": "This module provides comprehensive type definitions for the testing workflow system, enabling users to understand and track the entire test lifecycle from setup through execution. It structures all the data types needed to represent test planning, generation, validation, and execution phases, giving users visibility into each step of the automated testing process.\n\nUsers can monitor test generation as it progresses through distinct phases, seeing which functions are being tested, how many have completed, and any failures that occur along the way. The module supports detailed test execution reporting, including pass rates, error diagnostics with stack traces, and actionable recommendations for improving test quality. For test setup, users receive clear information about required test frameworks, dependencies to install, configuration files to create, and the overall status of their test environment, ensuring they have everything needed before test generation begins.",
