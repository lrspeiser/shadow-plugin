  "summary": "The bootstrap module serves as the initialization and configuration hub for the VS Code extension, responsible for setting up all user-facing components when the extension activates. It orchestrates the registration of commands, creation of tree views, and initialization of services that power the extension's code analysis capabilities.\n\nUsers interact with this module primarily through the extension's activation process, which automatically configures sidebar views for navigating products, viewing analysis results, exploring insights, examining static analysis findings, and managing unit tests. The module establishes a comprehensive command palette with commands for analyzing workspaces or individual files, copying analysis data to the clipboard, clearing cached data, accessing settings, viewing reports, and switching LLM providers.\n\nThe module enables a seamless workflow where file changes trigger automatic re-analysis, results populate in organized tree views, and users can access detailed information through navigation commands. Status bar integration provides at-a-glance feedback on analysis progress and current LLM provider status, while the diagnostics panel surfaces code issues and warnings in real-time.",
