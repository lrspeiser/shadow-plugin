  "summary": "The formatters module provides capabilities for transforming raw product documentation and codebase analysis into human-readable Markdown format. It serves as the presentation layer that takes structured data about a product's features, architecture, and insights and converts it into well-organized documentation that users can read and understand.\n\nUsers interact with this module's output when viewing generated documentation. The formatter creates comprehensive reports that include an overview section, detailed feature breakdowns organized by user perspective (GUI, CLI, API), key insights about the codebase, and technical considerations for developers. Each generated document includes a timestamp showing when it was created, helping users track documentation versions.\n\nThe module supports multiple documentation workflows: formatting complete product documentation with all perspectives and insights, generating focused reports on specific aspects like file analysis, and presenting domain-level understanding including architectural patterns and system themes. All output is structured as Markdown, making it easy to read in documentation viewers, code editors, or convert to other formats.",
