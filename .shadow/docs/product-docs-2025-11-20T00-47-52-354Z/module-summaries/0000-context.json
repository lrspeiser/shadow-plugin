  "summary": "The context module provides automatic preservation and formatting of code analysis results. When code is analyzed, this module captures the results and saves them to a dedicated .shadow/docs directory within the workspace, creating timestamped snapshots that can be referenced later.\n\nThis module acts as a bridge between the analysis engine and persistent storage, transforming raw analysis data into a structured format optimized for use with Large Language Models. Each analysis session generates a new snapshot, allowing users to track changes over time and maintain a history of their codebase understanding.\n\nUsers benefit from this module passively - as they analyze their code, the context module automatically handles the storage and formatting of results without requiring manual intervention. The preserved analysis data remains available across VSCode sessions, enabling faster subsequent analyses and providing a foundation for AI-assisted development features.",
