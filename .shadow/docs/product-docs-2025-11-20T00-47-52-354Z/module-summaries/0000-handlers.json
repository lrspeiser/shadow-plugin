  "summary": "The handlers module provides navigation and information display capabilities for exploring codebases within VS Code. It enables users to quickly jump to any code location - whether a file, function definition, or API endpoint - and view comprehensive details about code items in dedicated webview panels.\n\nThis module supports developer workflows by making code exploration intuitive and efficient. Users can navigate from high-level API endpoints down to specific function implementations, view function signatures with complete parameter information, and examine file dependencies. The module displays analysis results and code metrics alongside the actual code, helping developers understand both structure and quality.\n\nWhen navigation operations fail - such as attempting to access non-existent files or invalid line numbers - the module provides clear error messages to guide users. All navigation actions integrate seamlessly with VS Code's editor, opening files at the correct locations and presenting supplementary information in webview panels that don't disrupt the main editing workflow.",
