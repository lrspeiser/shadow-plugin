  "summary": "This module configures the testing infrastructure for the VSCode extension, enabling developers to write and execute automated tests. It establishes the testing environment with TypeScript support, ensuring that the extension's functionality can be validated through comprehensive test suites.\n\nThe configuration supports the development workflow by providing a standardized testing framework that integrates seamlessly with the extension's build process. This ensures code quality and helps catch regressions early in the development cycle, ultimately delivering a more reliable extension to end users.\n\nWhile users don't directly interact with this testing configuration, it underpins the quality and reliability of the extension features they use daily. The testing infrastructure validates that extension commands, UI interactions, and core functionality work as expected across different scenarios and edge cases.",
