  "summary": "This infrastructure module provides a standardized progress notification service for VS Code extensions. It enables developers to communicate the status of long-running operations to users through consistent, professional progress notifications that appear in the VS Code interface.\n\nThe module supports displaying titled progress notifications with updatable status messages, allowing users to track operations as they move through different stages. When operations are cancellable, users can click a cancel button in the notification to stop the operation mid-execution. The service manages the complete lifecycle of progress notifications, from initial display through updates to completion or cancellation.\n\nThis creates a unified user experience across all extension operations that require time to complete, such as file processing, API calls, or code generation tasks. Users receive clear visual feedback about what's happening and maintain control over long-running processes through the cancellation capability.",
