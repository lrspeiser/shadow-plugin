  "overview": "Shadow Watch is a VS Code extension that provides AI-powered code intelligence and automated testing capabilities for software development teams. The extension analyzes your codebase to generate comprehensive documentation, identify code quality issues, and create unit tests automatically. Users interact with the extension through multiple sidebar panels, command palette actions, and inline diagnostics that appear directly in the editor as you work.\n\nThe extension connects to AI language models (OpenAI GPT-4 or Anthropic Claude) to understand your code at multiple levels - from individual functions to entire product architecture. It automatically generates documentation describing what your application does, how components relate to each other, and what problems your code solves. The extension watches your files for changes and can automatically re-analyze your code as you save, keeping documentation and insights up to date.\n\nShadow Watch transforms time-consuming manual tasks into automated workflows. Instead of manually writing documentation, reviewing code for quality issues, or creating unit tests from scratch, users can generate these artifacts with a few clicks. The extension presents all analysis results in organized tree views, exports documentation in multiple formats optimized for different AI assistants, and provides detailed reports that help teams understand and improve their codebase.",

  "architecture": "Shadow Watch follows a layered architecture with distinct separation between user interface, domain logic, infrastructure services, and AI integration. The user interface layer consists of multiple VS Code tree view providers and webview panels that present analysis results, insights, and reports. These views receive data from the domain layer and respond to user commands through registered command handlers. The extension bootstrapper initializes all components during activation and establishes the communication pathways between layers.\n\nThe domain layer contains the core business logic organized into specialized services. The analysis services parse code files to extract structure, dependencies, and function information. The testing services orchestrate the complete test generation workflow from planning through execution and validation. The prompt builders construct structured instructions for AI models based on analysis requirements. The formatting services transform raw analysis data into human-readable documentation. All domain services coordinate with each other through well-defined interfaces and data structures.\n\nThe infrastructure layer provides foundational capabilities that support the domain logic. The file system services handle efficient file reading, caching, and watching operations. The persistence layer manages storage and retrieval of analysis results in a timestamped directory structure. The AI provider layer abstracts interactions with different language models (OpenAI, Claude) behind a common interface. Rate limiting, retry logic, and response parsing ensure reliable AI interactions. The configuration manager centralizes all user preferences and broadcasts changes to interested components. This layered design enables each component to focus on its specific responsibility while maintaining clean boundaries and testability.",
