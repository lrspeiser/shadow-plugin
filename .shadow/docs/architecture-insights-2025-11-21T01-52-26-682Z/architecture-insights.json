  "overallAssessment": "Architecture analysis identified 8 key strengths. See strengths section for details.",
  "strengths": [
    "Clear AI provider abstraction supporting OpenAI and Claude with factory pattern enabling seamless switching between LLM services",
    "Comprehensive caching strategy (24-hour duration) that reduces expensive AI API calls and maintains developer flow during active coding",
    "Modular domain services layer (src/domain/services/) demonstrating proper separation for testing, file watching, and incremental analysis",
    "Well-designed progress notification infrastructure providing consistent user feedback across long-running operations",
    "Intelligent file system layer with automatic filtering of non-source directories (node_modules, .git, dist) improving analysis performance",
    "Tree view providers offering native VS Code navigation patterns that integrate naturally with developer workflow",
    "Structured prompt engineering layer (src/domain/prompts/) ensuring consistent, high-quality AI interactions across features",
    "Robust error handling and retry logic in AI integration layer managing rate limits and network failures gracefully"

    "productPurpose": "Shadow Watch aims to transform software development teams' productivity by acting as an intelligent assistant that continuously understands, documents, and improves codebases. Its core mission is to eliminate the manual cognitive burden of understanding complex code, writing documentation, planning tests, and identifying quality issues by leveraging AI to automate these time-consuming activities while keeping developers in their primary workflow environment (VS Code).",
    "architectureRationale": "The architecture exists as a VS Code extension with a single entry point because the product's fundamental value proposition is seamless integration into developers' existing workflow without context switching. Unlike standalone tools or web services that require developers to leave their editor, Shadow Watch embeds all capabilities directly into VS Code where developers already spend their time. The single entry point (extension.js) reflects this focused integration strategy - the product doesn't need multiple entry points because it serves one primary user type (developers in VS Code) through one cohesive interface (the VS Code extension API). The architecture is organized around modular capabilities (analysis, AI integration, UI, persistence) because the product must handle diverse workflows (documentation generation, test planning, refactoring guidance) while maintaining fast performance through caching and incremental updates. The AI integration layer with multiple provider support (OpenAI, Claude) exists because the product's intelligence depends entirely on LLM capabilities, requiring flexible provider options for reliability, cost management, and access to different AI models' strengths.",
    "designDecisions": [
      "Modular architecture with separate analysis, AI, UI, and persistence layers - Reason: Enables independent evolution of each capability while supporting diverse user workflows from code analysis to test generation without creating a monolithic codebase",
      "Tree view providers for presenting results in VS Code sidebar - Reason: Provides familiar, native VS Code navigation patterns that developers already understand, enabling quick browsing of analysis results without learning new interfaces",
      "Inline diagnostics provider surfacing issues directly in editor - Reason: Meets users where they work by showing problems at their exact location rather than requiring navigation to separate reports, reducing friction in addressing issues",
      "24-hour caching layer for analysis results and AI insights - Reason: Eliminates redundant expensive AI API calls and re-analysis of unchanged code, ensuring fast subsequent loads critical for maintaining developer flow",
      "File watcher with automatic re-analysis on save - Reason: Keeps insights current without manual triggering, transforming Shadow Watch from a one-time analysis tool into a continuous monitoring assistant",
      "Iterative AI analysis supporting multi-round conversations - Reason: Enables comprehensive codebase understanding by allowing the AI to request additional context across multiple interactions, mimicking how humans explore unfamiliar code",
      "Support for multiple AI providers (OpenAI and Claude) - Reason: Prevents vendor lock-in, provides fallback options when one service is unavailable, and allows users to choose models best suited for their needs and budgets",
      "Rate limiting and retry logic in AI integration layer - Reason: Ensures reliable operation despite API limitations and network issues, critical for a tool that developers depend on during active coding sessions",
      "Export capabilities for HTML reports and AI assistant formats - Reason: Extends value beyond VS Code by enabling sharing with teams and integration with other AI-powered development tools like Cursor and ChatGPT",
      "Navigation handlers linking tree views directly to code locations - Reason: Reduces time to action by eliminating manual searching, enabling developers to jump immediately from insight to relevant code for remediation"
    ],
    "userGoals": [
      "Understand what an unfamiliar codebase does and how it's architected without reading every file manually",
      "Identify and fix code quality issues before they accumulate into technical debt or surface in code review",
      "Generate comprehensive documentation automatically to keep project knowledge accessible without manual writing burden",
      "Increase test coverage by automatically planning and generating tests for untested code",
      "Receive actionable refactoring guidance with concrete steps when dealing with complex legacy code",
      "Stay informed about code quality continuously without running separate analysis tools outside their editor",
      "Share analysis insights and documentation with team members who may not have the extension installed",
      "Reduce onboarding time for new team members by providing AI-generated explanations of architecture and purpose",
      "Maintain test suites efficiently by automatically detecting and fixing failing tests",
      "Make informed decisions about architecture and design patterns based on AI analysis of existing code"
    ],
    "contextualFactors": [
      "VS Code extension ecosystem integration requiring adherence to extension APIs and UI patterns",
      "Dependency on external AI services introducing reliability, latency, and cost considerations",
      "Real-time responsiveness requirements during active development sessions demanding efficient caching strategies",
      "Large codebase analysis requiring incremental processing and storage optimization to avoid performance degradation",
      "Multi-provider AI landscape requiring flexibility to switch between OpenAI, Claude, and future providers",
      "Developer workflow optimization demanding minimal context switching and maximum integration with existing tools",
      "Team collaboration needs requiring exportable formats that work beyond the VS Code environment",
      "Continuous monitoring requirements necessitating file watching and automatic re-analysis capabilities",
      "Iterative AI understanding patterns requiring multi-round conversations to build comprehensive codebase knowledge",
      "Cost sensitivity around AI API usage driving caching strategies and smart re-analysis triggers"
