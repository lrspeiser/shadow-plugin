# Test Run Report
Generated: 2025-11-26T16:12:08.431Z

## Summary
Test execution completed but no tests were actually run (0 passed, 0 failed). The build process succeeded with webpack compilation warnings and ESLint style violations.

## Results
- **Passed:** 0
- **Failed:** 0
- **Status:** 🧪 Some failures

## Analysis
The test suite appears to be configured but contains no actual test cases, resulting in 0 tests executed. The compilation was successful with 1 webpack warning about TypeScript dynamic dependency expressions. ESLint identified 11 style violations: 8 instances of missing curly braces after if conditions, and 3 naming convention violations for snake_case properties in API provider files (max_tokens, output_format, response_format). These are external API requirements conflicting with TypeScript camelCase conventions. No functional errors exist, only style and structural issues.

## Recommendations
- Add actual test cases to the test suite - currently no tests are being executed despite the test infrastructure being in place
- Add ESLint exception comments for snake_case properties in anthropicProvider.ts and openAIProvider.ts that are required by external APIs (max_tokens, output_format, response_format)
- Add curly braces to single-line if statements in llmResponseParser.ts (line 132), functionAnalyzer.ts (lines 199, 274, 275, 432), and analysisViewer.ts (lines 236, 251) to comply with ESLint curly rule
- Consider adding webpack configuration to suppress or resolve the TypeScript dynamic dependency warning in typescript.js, possibly by using IgnorePlugin for optional dependencies
- Create unit tests for core functionality like LLM providers, function analyzer, and analysis viewer to establish a baseline test coverage
- Set up test coverage reporting to track progress as tests are added
