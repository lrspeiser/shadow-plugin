  "summary": "This module provides documentation formatting capabilities that transform technical analysis and product information into well-structured Markdown documents. It serves as the presentation layer for both product documentation and code analysis insights, ensuring consistent formatting and organization that makes complex technical information accessible to human readers.\n\nUsers receive documentation organized into logical sections including overview summaries, feature lists, user perspectives for different interaction modes (GUI, CLI, API), and detailed technical specifications. The module formats code analysis results by grouping file behaviors by their roles and types, making it easy to understand how different components work together. All output includes timestamps and follows a consistent structure that supports quick scanning and comprehension.\n\nThe formatting workflow takes raw analysis data and product information as input, then applies structured templates to produce Markdown documents suitable for technical documentation, developer guides, and system understanding. This enables teams to quickly generate readable documentation from automated code analysis and maintain consistent documentation standards across products.",
