  "summary": "The infrastructure module provides a centralized progress notification service that keeps users informed during long-running operations. It displays standardized progress indicators with clear titles and status messages, ensuring users understand what tasks are currently executing and their progress.\n\nUsers can interact with progress notifications by canceling operations when needed, using the cancellation button that appears in the notification. The service intelligently displays progress in appropriate locations within the interface, including the notification area for prominent alerts, the window status bar for less intrusive updates, and the source control view for version control operations.\n\nThis module standardizes how the application communicates ongoing work to users, creating a consistent experience across all features that require user feedback during processing. It handles the complexity of progress reporting while providing a simple interface for displaying status updates and respecting user cancellation requests.",
