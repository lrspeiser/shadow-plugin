  "summary": "The Navigation Handler module provides comprehensive code navigation capabilities within the workspace. It enables users to seamlessly move between different code locations, whether they're files, functions, API endpoints, or other code elements that have been analyzed.\n\nThe module supports multiple navigation workflows: direct file opening in the editor, precise function location with automatic scrolling, and endpoint-to-implementation navigation. When users interact with analyzed code items, they can click to navigate to the source or view detailed information in a separate panel that displays signatures, parameters, and relationships.\n\nError handling is built into the navigation flow, providing clear feedback when files cannot be opened or navigation targets are unavailable. This makes code exploration intuitive and reliable, helping users understand and traverse their codebase structure efficiently.",
