  "summary": "This module provides comprehensive type definitions for the automated testing system, enabling users to track and monitor the entire test generation lifecycle. It defines the data structures that power test planning, generation, validation, and reporting capabilities throughout the application.\n\nUsers can monitor test generation progress through distinct phases, from initial setup through planning, generation, validation, and completion. The module supports tracking which functions are testable, which have been tested, and how they're prioritized. Users receive detailed feedback on test execution results, including pass/fail statistics, error details with stack traces, and overall test coverage metrics.\n\nThe type system enables users to review test setup plans showing required frameworks and dependencies, see which configuration files will be created, and get feedback on setup execution. Users can access comprehensive test reports that provide summary statistics, pass rates, and actionable recommendations for improving test coverage and quality.",
