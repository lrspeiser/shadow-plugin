      "summary": "This module establishes the testing infrastructure for the project by configuring Jest as the testing framework. It enables developers to write and execute TypeScript tests with proper module resolution, transformation, and coverage reporting.\n\nThe configuration supports developers in validating code quality and functionality through automated testing. It defines how test files are discovered, how TypeScript code is transformed for execution, and how coverage metrics are collected and reported. This ensures consistent testing practices across the development workflow.\n\nWhile this is a configuration module with no direct user-facing features, it is essential for the development process, enabling quality assurance through automated testing, continuous integration pipelines, and code coverage analysis.",
