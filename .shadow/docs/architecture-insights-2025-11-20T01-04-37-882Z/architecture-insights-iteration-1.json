  "overallAssessment": "Architecture analysis identified 10 key strengths. See strengths section for details.",
  "strengths": [
    "Clear AI provider abstraction through ILLMProvider interface enables swapping between OpenAI and Anthropic without changing domain logic - factory pattern ensures single instances and consistent configuration",
    "Layered architecture intent with distinct src/domain/, src/infrastructure/, src/ai/ directories shows architectural planning and separation of concerns at the directory level",
    "Comprehensive error handling infrastructure in src/utils/errorHandler.ts (362 lines) with retry logic in src/ai/llmRetryHandler.ts provides resilience against AI service failures and network issues",
    "Rate limiting in src/ai/llmRateLimiter.ts prevents API quota violations and ensures compliant usage of external AI services within provider constraints",
    "Multi-format export support (Cursor, ChatGPT, Generic, Compact) in src/llmFormatter.ts demonstrates flexibility for different AI assistant integration workflows",
    "File watching service with automatic re-analysis on save keeps documentation synchronized with code changes without manual intervention",
    "Incremental analysis with multiple LLM rounds in src/domain/services/incrementalAnalysisService.ts enables deep codebase understanding through progressive refinement",
    "Test generation workflow with environment detection, planning, execution, and automatic fixing provides end-to-end automated testing capabilities",
    "Structured JSON schemas in src/llmSchemas.ts ensure consistent LLM response formats across different analysis types and AI providers",
    "Persistent caching with 24-hour retention in .shadow directory with timestamped snapshots enables instant access to previous analysis results across sessions"
