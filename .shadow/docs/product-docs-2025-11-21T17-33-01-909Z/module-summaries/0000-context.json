  "summary": "The context module serves as a bridge between code analysis output and AI language model consumption. It automatically transforms technical code analysis results into a structured format optimized for LLM processing, ensuring that insights from code scanning can be effectively utilized by AI-powered features.\n\nWhen code is analyzed, this module saves the results to the workspace's .shadow/docs directory, creating a persistent knowledge base. This allows analysis data to be reused across sessions without requiring re-analysis, improving performance and maintaining continuity. The module handles the serialization and storage of complex analysis structures, making them readily accessible for downstream AI features.\n\nUsers benefit from this module transparently - their code analysis results are automatically preserved and formatted without manual intervention. The persistent storage means that documentation, code insights, and analysis metadata remain available even after restarting the development environment, enabling consistent AI-assisted workflows throughout the development lifecycle.",
