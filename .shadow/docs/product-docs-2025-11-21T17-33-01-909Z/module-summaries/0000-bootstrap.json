  "summary": "This module serves as the foundation for the VS Code extension, handling initialization and command registration. When the extension activates, it orchestrates the setup of all components including tree views for insights, status bar indicators, diagnostic panels, and file watchers. It ensures that all extension features are properly initialized and ready for user interaction.\n\nThe module registers a comprehensive set of commands that allow users to perform code analysis at workspace or file level, manage insights through copy and clear operations, switch between different LLM providers, and navigate to specific code locations. Users can trigger analysis, view results in multiple formats (tree views, diagnostics, reports), and interact with the extension through both UI elements and command palette entries.\n\nThe bootstrap process manages the complete lifecycle of extension components, ensuring proper dependency injection, event handling, and cleanup. It coordinates between analysis engines, storage systems, UI components, and external LLM services to provide a seamless user experience for code analysis and insight generation.",
