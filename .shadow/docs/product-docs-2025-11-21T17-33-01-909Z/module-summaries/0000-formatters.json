  "summary": "The formatters module provides documentation formatting capabilities that transform raw product documentation and LLM-generated insights into polished, user-ready Markdown documents. It takes structured documentation data and applies consistent formatting rules to create organized, readable documentation with clear sections for different audiences (GUI users, CLI users, API developers).\n\nUsers interact with this module when they view product documentation in their development environment. The module automatically formats documentation to include a product overview, categorized feature lists organized by user type and functional domain, detailed behavior descriptions following a structured framework, and technical insights generated by LLMs. Each document includes quality indicators like confidence scores and accuracy ratings, helping users assess the reliability of the information.\n\nThe module supports documentation workflows by ensuring consistent presentation across different products and documentation types. It organizes complex technical information into scannable sections, groups related features together, and presents dependencies and integration points in a clear format. Generated timestamps help users understand when the documentation was last updated, supporting documentation maintenance and review processes.",
