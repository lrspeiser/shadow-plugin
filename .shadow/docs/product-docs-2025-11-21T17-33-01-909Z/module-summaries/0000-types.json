  "summary": "This module provides TypeScript type definitions that structure the entire test generation and execution lifecycle. Users can view and track test plans that organize functions by priority, monitor progress as tests move through setup, planning, generation, and validation phases, and see detailed statistics on test coverage including counts of total, testable, generated, and validated functions.\n\nThe module enables users to receive comprehensive test execution results including pass/fail status for each test file, execution duration, error messages with stack traces, and overall test statistics. Users can access test reports that provide pass rates, file-level statistics, and actionable recommendations for improving test quality. The module also supports test environment configuration, allowing users to see what dependencies need to be installed, which configuration files will be created, and what mock requirements are needed for proper test execution.\n\nThrough these type definitions, users gain visibility into test failures with detailed error messages and retry attempt tracking, enabling them to diagnose and fix issues efficiently. The structured approach to test organization helps users understand which functions are being tested, their relative priority, and the overall health of their test suite through comprehensive reporting and progress tracking.",
