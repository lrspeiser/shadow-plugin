  "summary": "The infrastructure module provides a centralized progress service that manages how users are informed about ongoing operations throughout the extension. It creates a consistent user experience by displaying progress notifications with clear titles and messages whenever the extension performs time-consuming tasks.\n\nUsers interact with this module passively through visual feedback and actively when they choose to cancel operations. When any long-running task begins—such as file processing, API calls, or complex computations—the progress service automatically shows a notification that keeps users informed about what's happening. These notifications can appear in various locations within the VS Code interface, including the notification area and status bar.\n\nThe primary workflow involves the extension initiating an operation, the progress service displaying a notification with relevant status information, and users either waiting for completion or choosing to cancel via the notification's cancel button. This standardized approach ensures users always know when the extension is working and provides them with control over cancellable operations.",
