  "summary": "This module provides the testing infrastructure configuration for the project. It sets up Jest as the testing framework with TypeScript support, enabling developers to write and execute unit tests for the codebase.\n\nThe configuration establishes a Node.js test environment and integrates TypeScript preprocessing through ts-jest, allowing tests to be written in TypeScript alongside the source code. This ensures that the testing workflow matches the development workflow and maintains type safety throughout the test suite.\n\nDevelopers can use this configuration to run automated tests, verify code behavior, and maintain code quality through test-driven development practices. The setup provides a foundation for continuous integration and automated testing pipelines.",
