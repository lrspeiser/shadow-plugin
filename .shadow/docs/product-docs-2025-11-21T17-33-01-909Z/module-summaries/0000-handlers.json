  "summary": "This module provides comprehensive navigation capabilities that enable users to seamlessly move between different parts of their codebase directly from the product navigator and analysis viewer interfaces. When users interact with code items displayed in these views, the module handles opening the appropriate files in the editor and positioning the cursor at the exact location of interest.\n\nThe navigation system supports multiple types of code elements including files, functions, methods, and API endpoints. It automatically highlights the relevant code sections to help users quickly orient themselves in the file. When detailed information is needed, the module can display comprehensive details about code items in a dedicated webview panel, providing context without requiring users to search through files manually.\n\nThe module also handles edge cases gracefully by displaying informative error messages when files cannot be opened or navigation targets cannot be found. Additionally, it supports opening external links in the user's default browser, making it easy to access related documentation or resources referenced in the code analysis.",
