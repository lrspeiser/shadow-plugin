  "architecture": "The extension operates as a VSCode extension that integrates with the editor's workspace management and UI systems. At its core, it uses a multi-layered analysis engine that processes code files through static analysis and AI-powered interpretation. The system maintains an analysis cache to store results and avoid redundant processing, with a file watcher monitoring workspace changes to trigger incremental updates. Analysis results flow through formatters that prepare data for different presentation contexts.\n\nThe user interface consists of several coordinated components: tree views that organize and display structural information, webview panels that present formatted analysis and documentation, and diagnostic providers that surface findings in the editor. The AI integration layer communicates with language model services to generate insights, applying specialized schemas and prompts for different analysis types. Results are formatted and presented through viewers that provide navigation, search, and interactive exploration capabilities.\n\nThe architecture supports both on-demand and automatic analysis modes, with intelligent caching to balance responsiveness and accuracy. Analysis can target entire codebases for comprehensive insights or individual files for detailed documentation, with results aggregated and cross-referenced to build a complete understanding of the application being analyzed.",
