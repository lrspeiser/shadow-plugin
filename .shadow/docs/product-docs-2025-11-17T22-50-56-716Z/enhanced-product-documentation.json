  "overview": "Shadow Watch is a Visual Studio Code extension that continuously monitors codebases to detect architectural problems, generate AI-powered insights, and create comprehensive product documentation. It automatically analyzes code on every save, identifying issues like god objects (files over 1000 lines), circular dependencies, dead code, overly complex functions (over 100 lines), and poor file organization. The extension calculates a health score (0-100%) based on detected issues and presents findings through an interactive sidebar organized by severity: errors for critical problems like very large files, warnings for important issues like circular dependencies, and info-level suggestions for improvements. Shadow Watch integrates seamlessly with AI assistants like Cursor and ChatGPT by formatting insights into optimized prompts that developers can copy with one click, providing AI tools with complete context about architectural problems. The extension also generates product documentation and architecture insights by sending structured code analysis to language models, automatically creating user-facing documentation that describes what applications do rather than how they're built.",

  "architecture": "Shadow Watch operates as a continuously-running VSCode extension with a multi-stage analysis pipeline. The core analyzer performs static code analysis by parsing source files to extract structural information including line counts, function counts, import relationships, and code organization patterns. Analysis runs automatically whenever files are saved, with a file watcher detecting changes and triggering incremental analysis only on modified files. Results flow through an insight generator that applies rule-based pattern detection to identify architectural anti-patterns: files exceeding 1000 lines become errors, functions over 100 lines become warnings, and organizational suggestions become info-level findings. A health score calculator weighs all detected issues by severity to produce an overall codebase health percentage.\n\nThe caching layer stores analysis results with file hashes and timestamps, enabling the system to skip re-analysis of unchanged files and reduce processing time by approximately 80%. When users request AI-powered features, the LLM integration layer packages code analysis data into structured contexts conforming to specific JSON schemas, sends requests to language model services (OpenAI GPT models), and processes streaming responses back into formatted documentation or insights. The system saves all AI-generated outputs to a .shadow/docs directory with timestamped run folders, automatically loading the most recent results on extension activation to restore state.\n\nThe user interface consists of multiple specialized tree view providers, each implementing VSCode's TreeDataProvider interface to populate different sidebar panels. The insights tree view shows the main menu and static analysis results, while dedicated providers handle product documentation navigation, AI architecture insights browsing, and unit test exploration. An LLM formatter transforms insights into different output styles (Cursor-optimized, ChatGPT-verbose, Generic-markdown, Compact-bullets) based on user configuration. A diagnostics provider surfaces findings in VSCode's native problems panel, integrating Shadow Watch warnings alongside compiler errors for unified issue tracking.",

  "rawContent": "{\"overview\":\"Shadow Watch is a Visual Studio Code extension that continuously monitors codebases to detect architectural problems, generate AI-powered insights, and create comprehensive product documentation. It automatically analyzes code on every save, identifying issues like god objects (files over 1000 lines), circular dependencies, dead code, overly complex functions (over 100 lines), and poor file organization. The extension calculates a health score (0-100%) based on detected issues and presents findings through an interactive sidebar organized by severity: errors for critical problems like very large files, warnings for important issues like circular dependencies, and info-level suggestions for improvements. Shadow Watch integrates seamlessly with AI assistants like Cursor and ChatGPT by formatting insights into optimized prompts that developers can copy with one click, providing AI tools with complete context about architectural problems. The extension also generates product documentation and architecture insights by sending structured code analysis to language models, automatically creating user-facing documentation that describes

The core analyzer performs static code analysis by parsing source files to extract structural information including line counts, function counts, import relationships, and code organization patterns. Analysis runs automatically whenever files are saved, with a file watcher detecting changes and triggering incremental analysis only on modified files. Results flow through an insight generator that applies rule-based pattern detection to identify architectural anti-patterns: files exceeding 1000 lines become errors, functions over 100 lines become warnings, and organizational suggestions become info-level findings. A health score calculator weighs all detected issues by severity to produce an overall codebase health percentage.\\n\\nThe caching layer stores analysis results with file hashes and timestamps, enabling the system to skip re-analysis of unchanged files and reduce processing time by approximately 80%. When users request AI-powered features, the LLM integration layer packages code analysis data into structured contexts conforming to specific JSON schemas, sends requests to language model services (OpenAI GPT models), and processes streaming responses back into formatted documentation or insights. The system saves all AI-generated outputs to a .shadow/docs directory with timestamped run folders, automatically loading the most recent results on extension activation to restore state.\\n\\nThe user interface consists of multiple specialized tree view providers, each implementing VSCode's TreeDataProvider interface to populate different sidebar panels. The insights tree view shows the main menu and static analysis results, while dedicated providers handle product documentation navigation, AI architecture insights browsing, and unit test exploration. An LLM formatter transforms insights into different output styles (Cursor-optimized, ChatGPT-verbose, Generic-markdown, Compact-bullets) based on user configuration. A diagnostics provider surfaces findings in VSCode's native problems panel, integrating Shadow Watch warnings alongside compiler errors for unified issue tracking.\",\"titles\":[\"Shadow Watch
