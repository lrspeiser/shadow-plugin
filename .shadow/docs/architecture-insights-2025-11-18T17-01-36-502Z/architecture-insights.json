  "overallAssessment": "Shadow Watch exhibits a **layered monolithic architecture** that appropriately supports its mission as a VS Code extension providing continuous AI-powered code analysis. The architecture demonstrates intentional design decisions aligned with its core goals: multi-interface presentation (sidebar tree view, webview panels, inline diagnostics) for different information consumption patterns, provider-agnostic AI integration supporting OpenAI/Anthropic/custom endpoints, and file-watching with incremental caching for real-time feedback without blocking development workflow.\n\nHowever, the codebase shows **architectural drift** from its original domain-driven design intentions. While there are clear domain-driven directories (src/domain/bootstrap, src/domain/handlers, src/domain/prompts), the majority of business logic resides in large files at src/ root level (llmService.ts: 2,107 lines, llmIntegration.ts: 1,827 lines), creating a hybrid architecture where some modules follow DDD principles while core services remain monolithic. The presentation layer is well-distributed across multiple view components (analysisViewer, insightsViewer, insightsTreeView, productNavigator, staticAnalysisViewer, unitTestsNavigator), effectively supporting diverse developer workflows. The infrastructure layer shows partial organization with dedicated directories for AI providers, configuration, state management, and storage, but critical cross-cutting concerns like the LLM orchestration layer remain entangled with business logic.\n\n**Critical architectural tension:** The codebase architecture serves a single product (VS Code extension) with a single entry point (./dist/extension.js), yet exhibits organizational patterns suggesting preparation for multi-product expansion or library extraction that hasn't materialized. Domain-driven directories and abstraction layers exist alongside monolithic service files, creating inconsistent patterns where some modules follow clean architecture principles while others remain tightly coupled. The 14 root-level files (including 5 markdown documentation files, 2 VSIX packages, webpack config) indicate incomplete folder organization, while 3 orphaned files suggest either work-in-progress features or unused abstractions. The architecture successfully delivers on its core promise of AI-integrated static analysis with minimal friction, but would benefit from completing its evolution toward either full domain-driven organization or consolidating around a pragmatic layered monolith pattern.",

    "**Provider-Agnostic AI Abstraction**: Clean separation of AI provider implementations (src/ai/providers/) with factory pattern (providerFactory.ts) and interface-based contracts (ILLMProvider.ts). This architectural decision directly supports the product goal of working with OpenAI, Anthropic, and custom endpoints, enabling users to choose AI services based on organizational access, budget, or preference without code changes.",
    "**Multi-Interface Presentation Layer**: Well-distributed view components (analysisViewer, insightsViewer, insightsTreeView, productNavigator, staticAnalysisViewer, unitTestsNavigator) supporting different information consumption patterns. This aligns with the product goal of providing quick overview in sidebar during navigation, detailed reports in webviews for deep analysis, and inline diagnostics for immediate feedback while editing.",
    "**Incremental Analysis Architecture**: Dedicated services for file watching (src/domain/services/fileWatcherService.ts) and incremental analysis (incrementalAnalysisService.ts) with caching layer (cache.ts), supporting the product goal of real-time feedback on save without re-analyzing unchanged files. This enables continuous monitoring without blocking development workflow in large codebases.",
    "**LLM Response Handling Infrastructure**: Dedicated modules for rate limiting (llmRateLimiter.ts), retry logic (llmRetryHandler.ts), response parsing (llmResponseParser.ts), and state management (llmStateManager.ts). This layered approach to LLM integration provides robustness for the product's core differentiator: connecting static analysis to AI assistants.",
    "**Schema-Driven AI Validation**: JSON schema definitions (llmSchemas.ts) for validating AI-generated documentation and insights. This ensures structured, reliable responses from AI providers, preventing parsing errors that would break the user experience when displaying AI-generated content.",
    "**Formatter Abstraction Layer**: Separate formatter modules (llmFormatter.ts, documentationFormatter.ts) for provider-specific prompt templates. This supports the product goal of generating prompts optimized for different AI assistants (Cursor, ChatGPT, Claude) to increase likelihood of useful refactoring guidance."

  "organization": "The codebase exhibits **mixed organizational maturity** with incomplete evolution from flat structure toward domain-driven design. The src/ directory contains 19 files at root level including massive service files (llmService.ts: 2,107 lines, llmIntegration.ts: 1,827 lines) alongside properly organized subdirectories (src/domain/, src/ai/, src/infrastructure/, src/ui/, src/config/, src/context/, src/state/, src/storage/, src/utils/). This creates navigation friction where developers must check both root and subdirectories to find related functionality. Files at src/ root represent a mix of presentation components (analysisViewer.ts, insightsTreeView.ts, insightsViewer.ts, productNavigator.ts, staticAnalysisViewer.ts, unitTestsNavigator.ts), core services (llmService.ts, llmIntegration.ts, analyzer.ts), utilities (fileAccessHelper.ts, fileDocumentation.ts, logger.ts), and infrastructure (extension.ts, fileWatcher.ts, cache.ts, diagnosticsProvider.ts, insightGenerator.ts, llmFormatter.ts, llmSchemas.ts, unitTestsNavigator.ts).\n\nThe **domain layer organization** shows partial DDD adoption: src/domain/bootstrap/ handles extension lifecycle, src/domain/handlers/ contains navigation logic, src/domain/prompts/ manages prompt building, and src/domain/services/ provides file watching and incremental analysis. However, core business logic remains outside the domain layer in root-level service files, creating architectural inconsistency. The **infrastructure layer** demonstrates better organization with src/ai/providers/ containing provider implementations, src/infrastructure/persistence/ for storage, src/config/ for configuration, and src/state/ for state management, though progressService.ts is orphaned. The **presentation layer** is scattered across src/ root with six different view components (each 200-1000 lines) rather than consolidated in src/ui/, with only src/ui/webview/ subdirectory containing webview utilities. **Root directory clutter** is significant with 14 files including 5 markdown documentation files (GET_STARTED.md, IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md, MENU_STRUCTURE.md, PLUGIN_DESIGN.md, QUICK_START.md, REFACTORING_PLAN.md) that should be in docs/, 2 compiled VSIX packages (shadow-watch-1.0.0.vsix, shadow-watch.vsix) that should be in dist/ or .gitignored, and standard configuration files (package.json, tsconfig.json, webpack.config.js) appropriate for root but cluttered by documentation and artifacts.\n\n**Layer boundary violations** are evident: presentation components contain business logic (insightsTreeView.ts aggregates and transforms data, productNavigator.ts builds trees and manages state), business logic is split between domain services and root-level files, and infrastructure concerns (caching, file watching, logging) are intermixed with business logic in monolithic service files. The folder structure suggests intent for clean architecture but execution is incomplete, with some modules following DDD principles (domain subdirectories, provider abstraction) while core functionality remains in large, responsibility-mixed files at src/ root. **Missing organizational patterns**: no src/application/ layer for application services (use cases), no src/domain/models/ for domain entities, no src/domain/valueObjects/ for domain value types, no src/adapters/ for external integrations (VS Code, file system), and presentation components scattered rather than consolidated. The architecture would benefit from completing its evolution toward either full layered architecture (presentation, application, domain, infrastructure) or consolidating around pragmatic feature-based modules if clean architecture overhead isn't justified for extension size.",
  "entryPointsAnalysis": "Shadow Watch has a **single, appropriate entry point** (./dist/extension.js referenced in package.json main field) as expected for VS Code extensions. This aligns perfectly with the product architecture: VS Code extensions must export activate() and deactivate() functions from their main entry point, and Shadow Watch correctly implements this pattern in src/extension.ts (670 lines, 47 functions) which compiles to dist/extension.js. The extension.ts file serves as the **composition root** handling extension lifecycle, registering commands, initializing services, and setting up the file watcher for continuous monitoring. This single entry point architecture is **intentional and necessary** - VS Code's extension API requires exactly one entry point, and attempting to support multiple entry points (CLI, web service, library) would require extracting the analysis engine as a separate package consumed by multiple applications. The current architecture does not attempt this separation, keeping all functionality within the extension boundary. There are no additional entry points in package.json (no CLI bins, no additional main fields), confirming focused scope as a VS Code extension exclusively. The entry point appropriately delegates to extensionBootstrapper.ts (204 lines) in src/domain/bootstrap/, showing some architectural maturity in separating lifecycle management from core extension logic. **No entry point consolidation needed** - the single entry point is architecturally correct for the product's purpose as a VS Code-exclusive developer tool.",

This suggests either planned UX improvement that wasn't completed, or experimentation with progress tracking that wasn't adopted. Given that LLM analysis can take 10-30 seconds, progress tracking would improve user experience. (2) **src/ui/webview/baseWebviewProvider.ts** (84 lines) - Defines abstract base class for webview providers with common setup logic, but existing webview implementations (analysisViewer.ts, insightsViewer.ts) don't extend it.

Keep README.md at root (standard convention)\n   - Update package.json repository.url references if needed\n   - Add docs/ to .vscodeignore to exclude from extension package\n   - Impact: Significantly improves root directory navigation, standard practice\n\n2. **Handle Build Artifacts** - Remove or relocate compiled packages:\n   - Move: shadow-watch-1.0.0.vsix, shadow-watch.vsix → dist/ or remove from repository entirely\n   - Add *.vsix to .gitignore (build artifacts shouldn't be version controlled)\n   - Update build scripts to output to dist/\n   - Impact: Reduces repository size, prevents artifact confusion\n\n3. **Consolidate Presentation Layer** - Move scattered view components to src/ui/:\n   - Move: src/analysisViewer.ts, src/insightsTreeView.ts, src/insightsViewer.ts, src/productNavigator.ts, src/staticAnalysisViewer.ts, src/unitTestsNavigator.ts → src/ui/viewers/\n   - Keep src/ui/webview/ for webview utilities\n   - Update imports across codebase\n   - Impact: Clear separation of presentation from business logic, easier navigation\n\n**Medium-Term Refactoring (Requires Code Changes):**\n\n4. **Establish Application Services Layer** -

Impact: Separates orchestration from domain logic and presentation\n\n5. **Complete Domain Layer Organization** - Move business logic into src/domain/:\n   - Create: src/domain/models/ (domain entities like AnalysisResult, Issue, Insight)\n   - Create: src/domain/valueObjects/ (value types like Severity, Language, FileType)\n   - Create: src/domain/repositories/ (interfaces like IAnalysisRepository, IInsightsRepository)\n   - Move and decompose: src/llmService.ts, src/llmIntegration.ts → src/domain/services/ (split into focused services < 500 lines each)\n   - Move: src/analyzer.ts → src/domain/services/codeAnalysisService.ts\n   - Impact: Completes DDD architecture, establishes clear layer boundaries\n\n6. **Organize Infrastructure Layer** - Consolidate infrastructure concerns:\n   - Create: src/infrastructure/adapters/ (VS Code adapters, file system, logging)\n   - Move: src/fileAccessHelper.ts → src/infrastructure/adapters/fileSystemAdapter.ts\n   - Move: src/logger.ts → src/infrastructure/adapters/loggingAdapter.ts\n   -

      "description": "**If you want to support future expansion beyond VS Code extension** (CLI tool, CI/CD integration, web service, or library extraction): Complete the DDD migration by establishing clear layer boundaries with domain (business logic), application (use cases), infrastructure (external concerns), and presentation (UI) layers. Move all business logic from src/ root into src/domain/, create src/application/ for orchestration services, and ensure domain layer has zero dependencies on infrastructure (VS Code, file system, external APIs). This architecture enables extracting the analysis engine as standalone package consumed by multiple applications. **Rationale**: Current partial DDD adoption creates confusion about where to add features. Completing the migration provides clear architectural boundaries, makes testing easier (domain logic testable without VS Code mocks), and enables reuse of core analysis engine in contexts beyond VS Code.\n\n**If you want to maintain focus as VS Code-exclusive extension with simpler architecture**: Consolidate around pragmatic layered monolith by moving all files from src/ root into feature-based directories (src/analysis/, src/llm/, src/viewers/), remove domain/ subdirectories that add unnecessary abstraction overhead, and embrace VS Code coupling since extraction isn't a goal. This reduces architectural complexity while maintaining clear organization. **Rationale**: DDD overhead may not be justified for single-product extension.

Add progress indicators in llmService.ts for AI provider calls, incrementalAnalysisService.ts for workspace analysis, and insightsViewer.ts for documentation generation. Implement cancellation support for long operations. **Rationale**: Users currently experience black-box delays during AI analysis with no indication of progress or ability to cancel. Progress tracking significantly improves perceived performance and gives users control.\n\n**If current UX is acceptable and you want to minimize complexity**: Remove unused progressService.ts to reduce maintenance burden.

Create specialized subclasses that implement only view-specific rendering and behavior. **Rationale**: Current webview implementations duplicate 100+ lines of boilerplate for VS Code webview API setup, event handling, and resource management. Base class eliminates duplication and ensures consistent patterns.\n\n**If webview implementations are stable and working well**: Remove unused baseWebviewProvider.ts since attempted refactoring wasn't completed.

Application services depend on repository interfaces, not concrete storage implementations. Use factory pattern for repository instantiation. **Rationale**: Current direct file system access in incrementalStorage.ts and analysisResultRepository.ts makes it difficult to change storage strategies. Repository abstraction enables switching backends without changing business logic, supports easier testing with mock repositories, and aligns with DDD patterns.\n\n**If file system storage is sufficient and unlikely to change**: Keep current storage implementation as-is but consolidate incrementalStorage.ts and analysisResultRepository.ts into single storage module to eliminate duplication. Accept file system coupling to reduce abstraction overhead. **Rationale**: Repository pattern adds interfaces and indirection that may not be justified if storage requirements are simple and stable.

Define abstract interfaces (IFileSystem, ILogger, IConfiguration) that different environments implement. Create src/adapters/vscode/ for VS Code-specific implementations. Package analysis engine separately, consumed by VS Code extension as dependency. **Rationale**: Current tight coupling to VS Code (direct vscode module imports) prevents reuse in other contexts. Extraction enables offering Shadow Watch analysis in CI/CD pipelines, standalone CLI, or as library other tools integrate. Significantly expands market reach beyond VS Code users.\n\n**If Shadow Watch will remain exclusively a VS Code extension**: Keep current architecture with VS Code coupling.

Core issues: (1) Business logic concentrated in two massive files (llmService.ts: 2,107 lines, llmIntegration.ts: 1,827 lines) mixing orchestration, prompt building, caching, and business rules, (2) Partial DDD adoption with domain directories (src/domain/bootstrap, src/domain/handlers, src/domain/prompts, src/domain/services) alongside monolithic root-level services creating inconsistent patterns, (3) Presentation layer scattered across src/ root (6 view components, 4,000+ lines) with business logic mixed into UI code, (4) Circular dependency between cache.ts and analyzer.ts, (5) Root directory clutter with 14 files including 5 markdown docs and 2 VSIX packages, (6) Three orphaned files (progressService.ts, baseWebviewProvider.ts, webpack.config.js) indicating incomplete features.

    "architectureRationale": "The architecture exists to support continuous, non-blocking code monitoring integrated deeply into the VS Code development workflow. There is a single Node.js entry point (./dist/extension.js) because Shadow Watch is exclusively a VS Code extension that must hook into VS Code's extension API and lifecycle. The multi-interface presentation layer (sidebar tree view, webview panels, inline diagnostics, context menus) exists because developers need different ways to consume analysis results depending on their current task: quick overview in the sidebar during navigation, detailed formatted reports in webviews for deep analysis, and inline diagnostics for immediate feedback while editing. The external AI provider abstraction (OpenAI, Anthropic, custom endpoints) exists because the product's value depends on connecting analysis results to AI assistants, and developers use different AI providers based on preference, budget, and organizational policies. The LLM-ready prompt formatting exists specifically because the product's differentiator is not just detecting issues, but making them immediately usable with AI tools like Cursor and ChatGPT without manual reformatting.",
