  "overview": "Shadow Watch is a Visual Studio Code extension that provides continuous code architecture monitoring and AI-powered documentation generation. It automatically analyzes code on every save, detecting architecture issues like god objects, circular dependencies, dead code, and complex functions. The extension generates LLM-ready insights specifically formatted for AI assistants like Cursor, ChatGPT, and other language models, allowing developers to quickly get AI help with refactoring and code quality improvements. Shadow Watch supports nine programming languages including Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Go, Rust, C/C++, Ruby, and PHP.\n\nDevelopers interact with Shadow Watch through a dedicated sidebar in VS Code that displays a health score, categorized issues (errors, warnings, info), and one-click copy buttons for sharing insights with AI assistants. The extension offers multiple output formats optimized for different AI tools, making it easy to get context-aware suggestions from language models. Users can analyze entire workspaces, individual files, or let the extension monitor continuously in the background. All insights are clickable, allowing developers to navigate directly to problem areas in their code.\n\nBeyond static analysis, Shadow Watch uses AI providers (OpenAI and Anthropic) to generate comprehensive documentation including product overviews, architecture insights, refactoring reports, and unit test scaffolding. The extension maintains intelligent caching to ensure fast performance even on large codebases, with initial analysis taking 2-5 seconds for medium projects and incremental updates completing in under one second. Background processing ensures the extension never blocks code editing, providing a seamless development experience.",

  "architecture": "Shadow Watch is built on a modular architecture with clear separation between analysis engines, AI integration, presentation layers, and infrastructure services. The core analysis engine performs static code analysis using AST parsing to examine function-level structure, dependency graphing to track import relationships, and pattern detection to identify anti-patterns and code smells. This analysis runs continuously in the background, triggered by file save events through a file watcher service that monitors workspace changes. The analysis engine supports multiple programming languages through language-specific analyzers that understand the syntax and patterns of each supported language.\n\nThe AI integration layer connects to multiple LLM providers (OpenAI and Anthropic) through a provider abstraction with a factory pattern for runtime selection. This layer includes sophisticated prompt building that constructs detailed analysis requests with code context and schema definitions, response parsing that validates and extracts structured data from AI responses, rate limiting to handle API quotas gracefully, and retry logic with exponential backoff for resilience. A state manager maintains conversation context across multiple AI interactions, while a formatter system converts analysis results into different output formats optimized for various AI assistants (Cursor, ChatGPT, Generic, Compact).\n\nThe presentation layer consists of multiple specialized views including a tree view sidebar for navigating insights by category and severity, webview panels for displaying rich formatted documentation with syntax highlighting, and diagnostic providers for inline code annotations. A navigation handler enables clickable links that jump from insights to specific code locations. The infrastructure layer provides caching through both in-memory and persistent storage to optimize performance, progress tracking for long-running operations, error handling with graceful degradation, and a configuration manager for user preferences. The extension bootstraps through a command registry that exposes all functionality through the VS Code command palette, making every feature accessible via keyboard shortcuts and context menus.",

  "rawContent": "{\"overview\":\"Shadow Watch is a Visual Studio Code extension that provides continuous code architecture monitoring and AI-powered documentation generation. It automatically analyzes code on every save, detecting architecture issues like god objects, circular dependencies, dead code, and complex functions. The extension generates LLM-ready insights specifically formatted for AI assistants like Cursor, ChatGPT, and other language models, allowing developers to quickly get AI help with refactoring and code quality improvements. Shadow Watch supports nine programming languages including Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Go, Rust, C/C++, Ruby, and PHP.\\n\\nDevelopers interact with Shadow Watch through a dedicated sidebar in VS Code that displays a health score, categorized issues (errors, warnings, info), and one-click copy buttons for sharing insights with AI assistants. The extension offers multiple output formats optimized for different AI tools, making it easy to get context-aware suggestions from language models. Users can analyze entire workspaces, individual files, or let the extension monitor continuously in the background. All insights are clickable, allowing developers to navigate directly to problem areas in their code.\\n\\nBeyond static analysis, Shadow Watch uses AI providers (OpenAI and Anthropic) to generate comprehensive documentation including product overviews, architecture insights, refactoring reports, and unit test scaffolding. The extension maintains intelligent caching to ensure fast performance even on large codebases, with initial analysis taking 2-5 seconds for medium projects and incremental updates completing in under one second.

The core analysis engine performs static code analysis using AST parsing to examine function-level structure, dependency graphing to track import relationships, and pattern detection to identify anti-patterns and code smells. This analysis runs continuously in the background, triggered by file save events through a file watcher service that monitors workspace changes. The analysis engine supports multiple programming languages through language-specific analyzers that understand the syntax and patterns of each supported language.\\n\\nThe AI integration layer connects to multiple LLM providers (OpenAI and Anthropic) through a provider abstraction with a factory pattern for runtime selection. This layer includes sophisticated prompt building that constructs detailed analysis requests with code context and schema definitions, response parsing that validates and extracts structured data from AI responses, rate limiting to handle API quotas gracefully, and retry logic with exponential backoff for resilience. A state manager maintains conversation context across multiple AI interactions, while a formatter system converts analysis results into different output formats optimized for various AI assistants (Cursor, ChatGPT, Generic, Compact).\\n\\nThe presentation layer consists of multiple specialized views including a tree view sidebar for navigating insights by category and severity, webview panels for displaying rich formatted documentation with syntax highlighting, and diagnostic providers for inline code annotations. A navigation handler enables clickable links that jump from insights to specific code locations. The infrastructure layer provides caching through both in-memory and persistent storage to optimize performance, progress tracking for long-running operations, error handling with graceful degradation, and a configuration manager for user preferences. The extension bootstraps through a command registry that exposes all functionality through the VS Code command palette, making every feature accessible via keyboard shortcuts and context menus.\",\"titles\":[\"Shadow Watch Architecture Monitor\",\"Continuous Code Monitoring\",\"Architecture Issue Detection\",\"LLM-Ready Insights\",\"AI-Assisted Refactoring\",\"Product Documentation
