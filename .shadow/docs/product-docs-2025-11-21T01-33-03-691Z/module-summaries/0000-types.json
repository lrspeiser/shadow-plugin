  "summary": "This module provides comprehensive type definitions for the entire test generation and execution lifecycle. It defines the data structures that enable users to track test workflows from initial setup through planning, generation, validation, and completion. Users can monitor which functions are being tested, view their validation status, and track progress through each phase of the testing process.\n\nThe module supports detailed visibility into test execution results, providing statistics on passed, failed, and errored tests along with actionable recommendations for improvement. Users receive structured feedback about their test environment setup, including information about testing frameworks, required dependencies, configuration files, and existing test infrastructure. Error handling capabilities allow users to review detailed failure information including stack traces and retry attempts, enabling effective debugging and test quality improvement.",
