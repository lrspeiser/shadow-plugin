  "summary": "The infrastructure module provides a centralized progress notification service that keeps users informed during long-running operations. It delivers a consistent user experience by displaying progress indicators with customizable titles, status messages, and cancel functionality.\n\nUsers interact with this module passively through progress notifications that appear automatically when operations begin. The service displays real-time updates showing the current status of tasks, and users can cancel operations at any time using the cancel button in the notification. Progress can be tracked visually in multiple locations including the notification area and status bar, ensuring users always know when the application is working on their behalf.\n\nThis module serves as the foundation for all progress-related UI feedback in the application, standardizing how operations communicate their status to users and enabling a predictable, user-friendly experience across different features and workflows.",
