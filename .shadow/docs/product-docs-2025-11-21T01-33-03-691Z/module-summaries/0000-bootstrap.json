  "summary": "This module serves as the foundation and entry point for the entire VS Code extension, handling both command registration and component initialization. It wires together all the pieces users interact with - from the command palette actions to the sidebar tree views - and ensures they work cohesively.\n\nWhen the extension activates, this module establishes the complete user interface including the Insights viewer, Analysis panel, Product Navigator, Unit Tests view, and Reports viewer. It also sets up automatic file monitoring so that as developers edit code, the extension continuously re-analyzes and updates insights without manual intervention. The status bar displays real-time feedback about analysis progress and current state.\n\nUsers interact with this module's capabilities primarily through VS Code commands (accessible via command palette or context menus) that enable actions like analyzing the workspace, copying insights to clipboard, clearing cached data, switching LLM providers, and navigating through code structure. The module ensures all these commands are properly registered and connected to their underlying functionality, while also managing the visual feedback through diagnostics, tree views, and status indicators that appear throughout the VS Code interface.",
