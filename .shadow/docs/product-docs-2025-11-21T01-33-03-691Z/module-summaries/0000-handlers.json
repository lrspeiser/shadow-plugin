  "summary": "The Navigation Handler module enables seamless code navigation throughout the codebase from the product navigator and analysis viewer interfaces. Users can click on various code elements (files, functions, endpoints, entry points) to instantly open and position their cursor at the exact location in the editor.\n\nThis module orchestrates the complete navigation workflow: when a user selects an item in the navigator, the handler opens the corresponding file in the editor, positions the cursor at the relevant line number, and highlights the target code element. It supports navigation to multiple code artifact types including standalone files, function definitions, API endpoint implementations, and application entry points. The handler provides visual feedback through code previews and displays helpful error messages when files cannot be located or opened, ensuring users always understand the navigation outcome.",
