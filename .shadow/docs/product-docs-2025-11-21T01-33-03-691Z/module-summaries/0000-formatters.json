  "summary": "The formatters module transforms raw product documentation and AI-generated insights into polished, human-readable Markdown format. It takes structured data about a codebase and converts it into comprehensive documentation that users can easily read, understand, and export.\n\nUsers interact with this module when viewing generated documentation in their editor or exporting it to files. The module automatically organizes content into logical sections including product overviews, usage instructions segmented by interface type, technical architecture details, and AI insights. Each document includes a timestamp for version tracking and follows a consistent formatting structure.\n\nThe primary workflow involves receiving structured documentation data, applying formatting rules to create well-organized Markdown sections, and outputting the result for display or export. This enables users to quickly access professional-quality documentation about their codebase without manual formatting effort.",
