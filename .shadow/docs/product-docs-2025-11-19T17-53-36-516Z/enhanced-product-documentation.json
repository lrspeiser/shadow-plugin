  "architecture": "Shadow Watch is built as a VS Code extension with a modular architecture centered around AI-powered code analysis. The core analysis engine processes source code files and generates structured insights using configurable language models. The extension maintains state through persistent storage that tracks analysis results, progress, and incremental changes. A caching layer optimizes performance by avoiding redundant analysis of unchanged code. The architecture separates concerns into distinct layers: domain logic for business operations, infrastructure for external integrations, and presentation for user interface components. The system uses an event-driven approach with file watchers that trigger incremental analysis when code changes are detected. Analysis results flow through formatters that transform raw data into user-friendly documentation formats. The extension supports multiple AI providers through an abstraction layer that handles provider-specific communication, rate limiting, and retry logic. State management ensures consistency across multiple analysis operations and provides recovery from interruptions. The user interface layer consists of webview providers that render rich HTML content, tree view providers that organize hierarchical data, and navigation handlers that coordinate movement between different views and code locations.",

The core analysis engine processes source code files and generates structured insights using configurable language models. The extension maintains state through persistent storage that tracks analysis results, progress, and incremental changes. A caching layer optimizes performance by avoiding redundant analysis of unchanged code. The architecture separates concerns into distinct layers: domain logic for business operations, infrastructure for external integrations, and presentation for user interface components. The system uses an event-driven approach with file watchers that trigger incremental analysis when code changes are detected. Analysis results flow through formatters that transform raw data into user-friendly documentation formats. The extension supports multiple AI providers through an abstraction layer that handles provider-specific communication, rate limiting, and retry logic. State management ensures consistency across multiple analysis operations and provides recovery from interruptions. The user interface layer consists of webview providers that render rich HTML content, tree view providers that organize hierarchical data, and navigation handlers that coordinate movement between different views and code locations.\",\"titles\":[\"Code Analysis Engine\",\"AI Provider Integration\",\"Documentation Generator\",\"Insights Viewer\",\"Analysis Tree View\",\"Incremental Analysis\",\"File Watcher Service\",\"Progress Tracking\",\"Navigation Handler\",\"Refactoring Suggestions\",\"Product Documentation\",\"Architecture Insights\",\"Test Configuration Analysis\",\"LLM Service\",\"State Management\",\"Cache Management\",\"Webview Rendering\",\"Command Registry\",\"Error Handling\",\"JSON Response Parser\"],\"descriptions\":[{\"title\":\"Code Analysis Engine\",\"description\":\"Analyzes source code files to extract functions, classes, modules, dependencies, and relationships.
