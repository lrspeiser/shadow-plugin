      "summary": "This module provides the Jest testing framework configuration for the project. It sets up the testing environment specifically for TypeScript-based unit tests, enabling developers to write and execute automated tests that verify code functionality and prevent regressions.\n\nAs a development infrastructure component, this module does not expose user-facing features directly. Instead, it supports developers in maintaining code quality by providing a configured testing environment. The configuration determines how tests are discovered, executed, and reported, ensuring consistent test behavior across the development team.\n\nDevelopers interact with this configuration indirectly when running test commands (typically 'npm test' or 'jest'), which use these settings to execute the test suite. The module ensures that TypeScript files are properly transformed and tested, supporting the overall development workflow and continuous integration processes.",
