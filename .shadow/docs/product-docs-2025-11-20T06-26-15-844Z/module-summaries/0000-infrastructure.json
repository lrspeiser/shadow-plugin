  "summary": "The infrastructure module provides a centralized progress notification service that keeps users informed during long-running operations. Users can see real-time progress updates with descriptive titles and messages, allowing them to understand what the application is doing and how much work remains.\n\nThis module enables users to monitor operations that take significant time to complete, such as file processing, data analysis, or network requests. Progress notifications can appear in various locations throughout the interface, providing visibility without blocking other work. For operations that support cancellation, users can interrupt the process if they change their mind or need to prioritize other tasks.\n\nThe service handles the complexity of managing multiple simultaneous operations, ensuring that users can track several processes at once without confusion. Progress updates increment as work completes, giving users clear feedback about operation status and estimated completion.",
