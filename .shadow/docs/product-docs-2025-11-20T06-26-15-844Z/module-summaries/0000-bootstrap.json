  "summary": "The bootstrap module serves as the foundation layer that activates and initializes the VS Code extension, orchestrating all components necessary for code intelligence and analysis capabilities. When the extension starts, it automatically sets up analyzers, tree view providers, diagnostics panels, file watchers, and the status bar interface, making the full suite of features immediately available to users.\n\nThis module provides comprehensive command registration for all user interactions, including workspace-wide and file-specific analysis, insight management (viewing, copying, clearing), LLM provider configuration, and navigation through code structure and analysis reports. Users can trigger analysis through command palette actions or contextual menus, switch between different AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.), and manage their analysis data through various clearing and export operations.\n\nThe bootstrapping process establishes automatic workflows such as real-time file watching that triggers re-analysis when code changes, populating tree views with structured insights and test results, and displaying diagnostics for code issues. This creates a seamless experience where the extension continuously monitors the workspace and provides up-to-date code intelligence without manual intervention, while still offering granular control through registered commands for specific analysis tasks and configuration changes.",
