  "summary": "The Navigation Handler module provides comprehensive navigation and information display capabilities within the VS Code editor. It acts as the bridge between analysis results and the actual codebase, enabling users to seamlessly move from abstract analysis data to concrete code locations.\n\nUsers can navigate directly to files, functions, and API endpoints discovered during code analysis. When navigating to functions, the handler automatically positions the cursor and highlights the relevant code section. The module also provides rich information displays through webview panels, showing formatted code snippets with syntax highlighting, function signatures with parameter details, and file location information.\n\nThe primary workflow involves users interacting with analysis results (such as API endpoints, functions, or entry points) and clicking to navigate to their definitions in the code. The handler manages the entire process of opening files, positioning the editor view, highlighting relevant code sections, and displaying detailed contextual information. Error handling ensures users receive clear feedback when navigation attempts fail due to missing files or invalid locations.",
