  "summary": "This module provides the complete type system for automated test generation and execution workflows. It defines three core type categories: test setup types for environment configuration, test plan types for organizing and tracking which functions need tests generated, and test result types for capturing execution outcomes and generating reports.\n\nUsers interact with these types through a multi-phase workflow: first configuring the test environment with appropriate frameworks and dependencies, then planning which functions to test based on complexity and priority, generating tests for those functions, validating the generated tests, and finally executing them to produce detailed reports. The type system tracks each function's journey through these phases, maintaining status information, error details, retry counts, and timing metrics.\n\nThe module enables comprehensive visibility into the testing process, allowing users to see exactly which functions are testable, how many tests have been generated and validated, which tests are passing or failing, and where improvements are needed. Test reports include pass rates, execution durations, error messages with stack traces, and actionable recommendations for enhancing test quality. This structured approach ensures systematic test coverage across the entire codebase while providing clear feedback at every step.",
